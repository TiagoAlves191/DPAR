## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a **Python-based object detection and crowd monitoring tool** built using **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics).  
It allows real-time detection of multiple objects from a video or camera feed, focusing primarily on **people detection** and **crowd density estimation**.

When a potential **crowd gathering** is detected â€” i.e., when the average distance between detected individuals falls below a predefined threshold â€” the system:

- Connects detected bounding boxes with **red lines**,
- **Saves a snapshot** of the current frame,
- **Stores the data** in a database for later review,
- **Sends an alert message** to an operatorâ€™s phone.

The project includes a simple **Tkinter-based GUI**, **login system**, and **administrative dashboard** for reviewing historical records.

## ðŸ§  Core Features

- **YOLOv8 Object Detection**  
  Real-time detection of over 80 object classes using the `coco.names` file.

- **Person Tracking & Midpoint Calculation**  
  Draws bounding boxes and calculates the midpoint of each detected person.

- **Crowd Distance Analysis**  
  Computes average and relative distances between all detected people.  
  Flags potential crowd formations when predefined proximity limits are breached.

- **Automatic Snapshot Capture**  
  On crowd detection, saves a frame image automatically in a structured folder: agglomeration_screenshots/typeofdetection(video or live)/Year/month/day/hour/


  - **Alert Notifications**  
Sends a mobile message to a preconfigured operator when a crowd is detected.

- **Database Logging & Admin Dashboard**  
All detections are logged in a database and can be viewed via a secure admin login interface.

- **User Authentication**  
Simple login system to manage access to the admin dashboard.
